In this case, if the start button and stop button are dependent, then the answer would be different.

Why, untrained people are able to look and modify the code they dont understand.
Also, I think all graphical languages should be abolished as they give little to no value for the development of complex systems. Tools for these languages do not exist. I use ST as I can write practically whatever I want, have a structure and a nice architecture. I can build my own tools to write and analyze the code as it is just text. Im not saying ST is good either, its the best out of all IEC languages. But in the long run, it too is stuck in the 90s."

It is a simple language for making simple things. When you want to make code that is not simple it gets to complicated to program. Then it is better to go for Structured text or function blocks. Looking at PLC manufacturers they actually allow you to put functionblocks into the ladder code to facilitate advanced coding in ladder. In the old days automation was made with relays. You could find quite amaizing functions made up of only relays. To day everything is built in PLC-code. There is no actual argument of keeping ladder-programming alive. Only for historical reasons.
